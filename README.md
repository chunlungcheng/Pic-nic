# Pic-nic
See what is going on in your city! Discover things to do or sights to see from others in your area, updated daily. Post a photo to your city’s feed, whether it be a good cup of coffee, a sunset, or a delicious meal. 
You can share, like, or comment on any photo you see to get more detail. Each photo is geotagged so you can see where it was taken. Think of Instagram but for only your city, and the feed is deleted at the end of each day.

## Differences  
- User Authentication (Email and Password) was completed, but we had an original plan of including a profile picture to associate with each user. That extra screen and Firebase connection will be implemented in the next phase

- Users now can take a photo and see it on the Camera screen, but we haven’t implemented the Firebase upload. 

- We decided to implement the Comment screen early.
